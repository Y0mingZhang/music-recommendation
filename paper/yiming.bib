  abstract = {We propose a generative model for text and other collections of dis(cid:173) crete data that generalizes or improves on several previous models  including naive Bayes/unigram, mixture of unigrams  [6],  and Hof(cid:173) mann's  aspect  model,  also  known  as  probabilistic latent  semantic  indexing  (pLSI)  [3].  In  the  context  of text  modeling,  our  model  posits  that  each  document  is  generated  as  a  mixture  of  topics,  where  the  continuous-valued  mixture  proportions  are  distributed  as  a  latent  Dirichlet  random  variable.  Inference  and  learning  are  carried out efficiently  via variational  algorithms.  We  present  em(cid:173) pirical  results  on  applications  of this  model  to  problems  in  text  modeling,  collaborative filtering,  and text classification.},

  abstract = {As one of the most successful approaches to building recommender systems, collaborative filtering (CF) uses the known preferences of a group of users to make recommendations or predictions of the unknown preferences for other users. In this paper, we first introduce CF tasks and their main challenges, such as data sparsity, scalability, synonymy, gray sheep, shilling attacks, privacy protection, etc., and their possible solutions. We then present three main categories of CF techniques: memory-based, model-based, and hybrid CF algorithms (that combine CF with other recommendation techniques), with examples for representative algorithms of each category, and analysis of their predictive performance and their ability to address the challenges. From basic techniques to the state-of-the-art, we attempt to present a comprehensive survey for CF techniques, which can be served as a roadmap for research and practice in this area.},
